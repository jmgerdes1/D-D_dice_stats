WIP- project to learn Python and TKinter

convolve.py contains all functions related to calculating the Expected Damage per Round.

Overall, program is capable of calculating EDPR

  Add error message for when EDPR can't be calculated (like when the damage dice settings are left blank)

  Add graphing capabilities. Graph EDPR against AC for given settings.

    Add ability to save graphs? Plot multiple at once to compare Steady Aim, Sharpshooter, neither, or both?
